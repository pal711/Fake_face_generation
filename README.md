## Fake face generation
I am doing this project as part of Udacity Nanodegree. Here I am producing fake faces using [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) based on a filtered dataset. <br>
<br>
### About the Dataset
The dataset is corped to 32x32 image of face only, the surroundings of the picture is discarded. The training data is not included in this repository.
