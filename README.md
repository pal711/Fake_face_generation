## Fake face generation
I am doing this project as part of Udacity Nanodegree. Here I am producing fake faces using [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) based on a filtered dataset. <br>
<br>
### About the Dataset
The dataset is corped to 32x32 image of face only, the surroundings of the picture is discarded. The training data is not included in this repository.

### About the Notebook and Training
The GAN was not trained on my personal laptop. It is not that powerfull to handel the workload. So I have trained this in Udacity's GPU Environment.

### About the files
_dlnd_face_generation.ipynb_ - is the notebook where everything is shown <br>
_dlnd_face_generation.html_ - is the same as notebook only it is in html format<br>
_problem_unittests.py_ - Consists some checks for proper implementation by Udacity<br> 
_assets_ - Has 1 Picture for that is used in one of the markdown cells in the notebook
